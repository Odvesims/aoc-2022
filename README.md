Day 1

Given a list of elf's calories, find the elf carrying the most calories and also the sum of calories for the top 3 carriers. 

Data is given in a txt file. Calories per elf are separated by a blank line. The total amount of calories that an elf carries is equal to the sum of the file's lines pertaining to that particular elf.
